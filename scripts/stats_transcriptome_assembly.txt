###use these commands to get an idea of the quality of the transcriptome assembly

#run these commands in the command line
#search for certain pattern in the merged_all.gtf

#get number of exons and transcripts
awk 'BEGIN {exons = 0 ; transcripts = 0} {if ($3 == "exon") {++exons} ;if ($3 == "transcript") {++transcripts}} END {print "exons: " exons "\n" "transcripts: " transcripts}' merged_all.gtf
#total number of exons: 1,532,315
#total number of transcripts: 240,721

#get number of genes (without duplicates)
awk '{print $10}' merged_all.gtf | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
#total number of genes: 58,111

#get number of novel genes (novel genes have transcript IDs with pattern "MSTRG.NUMBER")
awk '{print $12}' merged_all.gtf | sort | uniq | grep "MSTRG" | wc -l
#total number of novel genes: 3,777

#get number of genes and transcripts that have at least two exons
awk '{print $14}' merged_all.gtf | grep '2' | wc -l
#total number of genes and transcripts with more than one exon: 398,276
